1,the UFC is starting to become a joke. it started out as something amazing and slowly started to become about money and only money. even dana admitted that he barely sold any fights so that's his whole reasoning for trading him for a dude who holds the record for taking the fastest ass whooping in the entire federation. amazing. not even about whos the best anymore.,2023-09-29T06:01:54Z,0

16,"Dana's management is very childish. ONE is far more mature, but then again Pride and K1 were also amazing circuits and UFC only got as popular due to the lack of knowledge of Asian circuits for Western Audiences. MMA was such an exciting new novelty for them, it plunged UFC to instant popularity despite the extreme lack of maturity leading to many injuries, scandals, and infamous characters that make the face of UFC. Good fighters were blessed to be part of it and made a killing and legacy of couse. Iceman Lidell, GSP, Rampage Jackson so on. But also guys like Tito Ortiz, McGreggor, and Strickland make the circuit hard to watch seriously. Yes they're all good fighters, but are obnoxious AF. Unfortunately UFC values the drama they create and Dana puts them front center for hype often. Even the female division compared to ONE is not as mature.

It's good that Mighty Mouse got to go to a proper organization that takes care of its fighters more it seems. The way they promote is fun, it's relatable, it shows alot of respect. Their fighters seem to respect the audience, sport, and each other far more than UFC.

I think Dana just watched too much wrestling as a kid and tried shaping the UFC like a WWE style show but forgot that WWE is more acrobatic and showmanship than actual fighting.",2023-09-17T12:25:26Z,0

27,"The African American families were broken up deliberately by the social engineers advising the government, paid for by the private bankers. We are seen as just fodder to be experimented upon by the rich and powerful. Not just Black people but every race and creed. Single mothers are a product of these social engineers. Everything is, all without our consent and supposedly in our best interest. They've been doing it forever and they have no intention of stopping any time soon. We are being farmed and the average person is clueless of this fact. Why are they clueless? Well, sports are a big part of the problem, they serve as a distraction, they keep the minds of the masses distracted from really thinking about why their lives are as they are. It's just simple psychology in most cases but since the internet was introduced it has become a lot more sophisticated. Of course people have been conditioned to enjoy watching people compete against each other either alone or as part of a team and it can be enjoyable but never forget it's ultimate purpose, which is to keep you from ever questioning the authority of the establishment and who granted them this authority?",2023-09-11T21:43:05Z,0

66,One is a full combat organization with a better rule set. UFC does not treat its fighters with the same respect. UFC needs to quit being run like a corporation but wait it is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so One has this power to do great things for the sport by showing a certain level of integrity and respect. I love UFC but I love Pride tooooo and that made me realize UFC bought the Pride fighters but did not get the rule set. So it‚Äôs clear UFC needs to do two things. Make all 650+ fighters have health insurance and get the knees to a grounded opponent and fights judged as a whole or a similar rule set. One btw tried USA soil but not with the same Rule set it has in Asia. So both have some lessons to learn. But UFC has clearly done better but has to change how they treat health and pay to only 650 fighters very public and now. ‚ù§ to all on earth.,2023-08-10T22:27:30Z,0

Everyone is different but around the Conor era once that dropped off i've seen a big drop in fights that seems exciting to watch, pulling out old teeth now like Jones and hinting every now and then at super fights isn't going to keep the fans watching long term in my opinion.
I've only been watching UFC since the early spider days so i'm not going to go tooting around too much and i'm sure UFC is fine and dandy but for someone who likes high paced exciting martial arts I feel One fighting has better viewing.
respect everyones thoughts and views, i'm more than confident however there are others who feel ufc has slipped.
I'm glad Mighty Mouse made the transition into the eastern arena, he is better looked after for someone with his skills and what he brings to the world of MMA and his time wont last forever and deserves to be looked after.

172,"I'm 45 years old andive been watching MMA for decades, I got into through kickboxing, I liked boxing but loves kicking and as a kid I thought well theres got to be a sport out here that does both, so I found Muay Thai and fel in love with it and that started my journey of combat sports. Naturally living in America we have wrestling in school that's it so I went after that. Went into the army traveled around and seemingly got more and more exposure into the world of combat sports. So yea it's kinda crazy to see western people (us americans) just sit here and think the UFC is it. There are so so so many other organizations around the world that are packed with extremely talented and skilled exciting fighters. The difference between the UFC and others is other organizations fighters fight because that's wo thy are that's their life, the UFC is lucrative in as how much they pay, it's just such a western capitalistic thing compared to other organizations. The UFC has huge talent don't get me wrong but the last 10 years a lot of fighters are crying about pay. If you decide you want to fight for a living and get into it not making all that much money and yu keep doing it for the love and challenge what changes??? Never understood that,,,, compared to us Norma people professional fighters get paid very well and get a bunch of French benefits us civilians for lack of a better word never see for ourselves so to me some fighters are just a bunch of whiny fucks. DJ is a rare fighter, loves it trains hard fights for his family and money is something he doesn't seem to care about andthat refreshing to see a fighter be like that andnot act like an actor who's butt hurt about having missed out on an extra 50k. You wanna fight and be a fighter or do you wanna be rich? I used to love Connor when he first came on to the scene, he started making money and all that disappeared, nothing wrong with bettering yourself but I just love seeing that hunger in a person and still being humble and ding something thy love and are good at, the second money is involved it ruins al that and that sucks",2023-04-25T10:28:11Z,0

And I hope more ufc stars migrate there and force Dana to submit to adhering to principles approaching basic human decency...even if those actions are out of self preservation...itd still be a strong statement.

DJ loved playing the role of the Harlem Globetrotter going against the Washington Generals at the flyweight. Anyone remember DJ building up Ray Borq for his title defense? DJ west as far as to claiming that all his flyweight opponents are all ""future champions"". DJ dominated majority of his fights because he really was that good, but he seemed to be scared of fighting anyone who would pose a challenge to him. DJ ducked TJ with conditions that TJ needs to fight another fighter if he goes to 125 before fighting DJ When DJ loses a fight, he does not have a rematch mentality. Instead he runs away so that they won't be able to fight again. After Dominick Cruz ragdolled DJ at 135, DJ ran to 125. When Henry Cejudo destroyed DJ in their 2nd fight, instead of wanting that 3rd match, DJ runs to One.

He headlined 6 main events, they put him in a rare title tournament, they even put him on the cover of the UFC3 video game.

DJ's lack of ticket sales was more likely impacted by:

A) Most casual fans don't like the lighter weight classes (especially in the ""West"") 
B) DJ didn't like to promote himself, other than playing games on Twitch (which doesn't have a lot of crossover appeal with MMA)

Neither of these situations are ideal, but neither could be easily remedied by the UFC.",2023-01-17T01:49:24Z,1

With dj the division was new he just ran through everyone because he was the best (same thing jones done) it would be completely different if they had all fought each other and established themselves then dj comes in like jones and takes them all out. If the lightheavyweight division was new and jones runs through everyone like dj people wouldn‚Äôt be interested. Again when you break it down djs opponents were highly skilled.

860,"This is one the biggest mistakes the ufc  ever with them losing best and greatest flyweight as well as fighter of all time. Poor business decision as now one fc had an American champ who they could claim was the best flyweight on the planet. What the ufc got was a semi-retired, out of prime welterweight champ who should have been signed years ago. On top of that they lost Francis and Nate who are still willing to fight. If this trend continues and they start losing more important fighter due dissatisfaction or their own poor decision making the ufc will lose their main appeal which is having the biggest and the best fighters. 

Who is next, Yan wanted to leave due the Omalley fight, Ankaleav was devastated after his split-draw, Zhalgas Zhumagulov literally retired after losing 2 straight controversial decisions with a total ufc record of 1-5 with 3 of the loses being controversial. Felice Herrig literally cried about not feeling valued due to other fighters being possibly prettier.
