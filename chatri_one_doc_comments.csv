0,I love it a true martial artist seeming to base a fight organization around being a fighter and what that means not a new WWE.  No heels no storylines that are inflated egos or simply not true just the honest truth and brutal clarity that comes from being a martial artist.  One love,2023-09-30T18:09:50Z,0

Those are called ""cowards"". I can't stand hearing these stories where people try to excuse stuff like this, or explain it. I mean I don't blame them for trying to explain it or for trying to make it more positive than what it was I mean it's like your dad so of course....but c'mon bruh. Even if your family is struggling then you go down with the ship or you do anything possible to escape the bad situation. The only possibility you don't do is to abandon ship on the people that you say you're committed to, but then leave bc you're too weak to see it or handle it. With situations this bad I almost always want to side with the people but when the people abandon their family, no, I abandon you. 0 respect. Reminds me so much of the pathetic ""men"" in some of these stories I hear, where they pretend like they care so much about something that they have to abandon it because they just ""care so much"". But that's so far from the truth that it's actually the exact opposite. If you truly cared about your son or wife, you do ANYTHING you can. Not nothing u can. That's the opposite of ""giving it all you got"". No wonder women took over the world when you've got ""men"" starting families and then running away terrified of the aftermath THEY created.

The first part was great, but when we came to this country it was hard and chaotic. 

My father ended becoming an alcoholic and eventually died. And through all this, I was dealing with resentment and love for him.  

the morning that he was dying, I dreamed of him. Just him and I watching the dodger beat the A‚Äôs in the 88 World Series. 

The best memory ever. Then my mom woke me up, to tell me my dad was not feeling well, his liver was shot and diabetes was damaging him.

So While we were waiting for the ambulance, my older brother told me to watch my dad for a shot minute. 

While I was there with him. Just him and I‚Ä¶ my dad looked at me. And I really didn‚Äôt understand the whole thing so I just tried to talk to him. 

He then Smile at me,  and then I saw in eyes turn grey instantly‚Ä¶ he died at 4:30am. 

For so long I‚Äôve had this memory.

I now see, my father was asking for forgiveness. He too was very proud and it became hard for him to put food on the table..

I‚Äôm finally sober, alcohol took me away for many years‚Ä¶ And have forgiven him as well.

Was Pride FC not a gigantic organisation that at one time DID take some of the South American and Yank talent over but the Yanks usually went there rather than UFC because they were full of Steroids lets be honest.

Now the biggest stars have retired or are about to do that.  Only real stars that have the ability to be great champions and the future of the ufc are sugar, gaetje, izzy might have 5 more good fights in the tank and some guys out of khabib stable. Dustin is done, Nate sadly left, Francis left, Bones and Stipe might do 2-3 more fights max and they are done, kumaru will soon be over, Volka might keep going for a bit. Mc Gregor is challenging every fighter, but looks like a coke snorting lesbian in a leprechaun costume.

Martial arts is not about fighting but rather a  journey of improvement and of awareness.

This implies not only for oneself, but also to help others, in particular upon those, who are defenseless--who are victimized!
Fighting just so happens to be secondary!

The journey of improvement is full of fighting, every step of the way. The fights occur in the spirit, within the mind,  our hearts, speeches and bodies.

This occurs within a variety of rings, cages and mixed martial arenas.

If you want peace, prepare for war, but when you are tired of war, learn to become at peace.

We are all at war, whether you like or not, it is upon us!

Thai, my favorite food and martial art style of physical fighting.

It is not necessarily an eight count system but rather an 11 count system, 12 including grappling.
1 head: one must always use their heads, and not necessarily a head butt. Which is illegal in the ring, but this is life!
2 hands-this could be knuckles or palms
2 elbows
2 shins
2 knees
2 feet = 11 + grappling = 12

Without getting into the preaching side too much.

I preach the 11 Engine of the LAW Holy Commandments of my LORD, of whom I serve faithfully and with all of my heart, mind, speech body and soul, to the best
of my abilities.

My LORD sits at the right hand side of my LORD: YAHWEH and YESHUA!

We must never forget the SECOND greatest Commandment!

10 + 1 = 11 
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11 =  66, The Books of my Roadmap, the Holy Bible!

Where does number two sit in relation to number 1? The right hand side, so too does my LORD, my RABBI, my MESSIAH!

Back to the real fighting of life! 
LOVE is the most powerful force, and we must love our enemies, doing good to those who persecute us.


LOVE

If your opponent is stronger, strike back at their heart, by flooding their mind with more love.
A moment to be mindful, making good use of matter!

You may still be their enemy, but they are not yours.
The greatest threat became themselves!

If your opponent is weaker, strike back at their heart, by flooding their mind with more love.
A moment to be mindful, making good use of matter!

You may still be their enemy, but they are not yours.
The greatest threat became themselves!

If you opponent is equally matched, strike back at their heart, by flooding their mind with more love.
A moment to be mindful, making good use of matter!

You may still be their enemy, but they are not yours.
The greatest threat became themselves!

The best offense is to stop fighting, therefore there is no winning or losing, there simply is what needs to be.
Time to let go, friction and stress are not how it was supposed to be!

Vengeance is not ours; what remains is our willingness to start fighting the true enemy!

I love you all  very much.

Sincerely,

a man and a little child too!

Also its Asia, cmon no one follows their news stories n alot of their stories of powerful ppl n big companies dont get covered in news when bad things happen,  it aint the western world ppl, its more corrupt in Asia due to government powers overextending.

people need to think about it, if you cant get a job  n u only have fighting skills, what would u do?  course  u get hired as muscle and its more common then u all think, lots of organized crime groups look for combat fighters to employ while some venture into their own street gangs before leaving once they build up a big name and get signed by a big promotion .

1068,"This makes me want to start watching ONE. The most disguising thing I've seen in MMA  history was Jon Jones being crowned pound for pound #1. That is just absolutely stomach churning. 

I'm not saying Jones isn't skilled. He's great skill wise but steroids are illegal for a reason. He cheated. And he's likely been cheating his entire career and you can't get that back. You can't go back in time and change things now. Because of his mental weakness we'll never know what could have happened. He's effectively changed the course of history. There are fighters out there who never became champion and there's no way to tell if they would have beaten a clean version of him or not. Even worse, there are families who had to go without because of it. Kids missed out on a better life because of that shitbag. 

In any other sport steroids are frowned upon. Baseball players, football players you name it.  When a fighter tests for drugs in those sports it's almost universally frowned upon. Olympic medals have been stripped over steroid use. So why, in MMA, where you are in a  one on one match where the whole object is to hurt your opponent, is it okay to do steroids. Why aren't records wiped for UFC fighters? I think it should be a one and done. The lightest pinishment a fighter should recieve for using steroids in combat sports is a lifetime ban. But even that is getting off lightly. If there were truly justice these scumbags should be charged with a felony. Just look at Michael Bisping. He was permanently disfigured by a guy who was jacked  on TRT. When are they going to start talking this seriously? Does someone have to die? 

The worst part is that the whole reason Jon gets special treatment is because of insecure casual fight fans who want to starch their own self worth to a fighter they've never even met.  I've noticed a trend in MMA that's gotten worse over about the last 10 years. People will brag that ""their fighter"" won. It's not about the sport anymore. Used to people watched to see who's skillset would prove to be the best on that night. I don't remember people getting that upset after a match in the early days of MMA. 

If i had to pinpoint where it all went wrong I'd say it was around the time social media blew up. People have become so self absorbed. We're in an era where we've normailzed taking pictures of yourself to show out. People live and die by how many likes they can get. The end result is people developing a fragile eggshell ego. People will claw and scratch for any small morsel of success. People will actually ignore the fact that a guy blatently cheated just so they can say ""Look. My fighter won."" 

I don't think MMA is the only thing that social media has infected. I've seen these trends all over the world but for the porpose of this topic I'll only point out how it's affected MMA. I hope that ONE can somehow restore honor back to MMA. You shouldn't be able to just trash talk your way past someone who's more deserving of a title shot. And you damn sure shouldn't get away with endangering another humans life by cheating.",2023-07-10T05:07:02Z,1

A man America made and no other country on Earth could have propped up is now missing years of life with his father because he was off chasing dollars. I'd rather have built time with my father than rolling dollars into more dollars. He notes his father was brittle and suffering on the streets while he was in New York and Silicon Valley, what a terrible existence the men in that family have lived to have let dollars rule them. You don't need television to have heroes, you don't need sports to have heroes; his hero was the man laying near death on the streets of his home country that now isn't alive because his eldest son abandoned him and left him for dead. What might have made this man a hero for is if he passed up scholarships and dollars and handouts to sell fruit with his father and rebuild their home. I've seen many of those stories in my travels around the world and they far outpace this. In 2,000 years ONE will be gone and nobody will give a damn about it but i hope there is a history book that tells the tale of a man who left his dad for dead to chase dollars and sports, to serve as a lesson for humanity.",2023-06-08T05:25:18Z,0

1551,"While I need to tip my hat because of the (once again) excellent production value and editing of this video, I disagree with the title. ONE is far from being a threat to the UFC. ONE is operating on a market that is culturally (and also strategically) VERY segregated from the UFC. And while they reach more households than the UFC, the UFC is far more effectively monetized (wheras ONE has been bleeding money in the dozens to hundreds of millions for years!) and draws better MMA fighters.

People underestimate, just how rigid of a stranglehold the UFC has over the sport of MMA. It is practically seen as it's premier division, so to speak. And it shows in roster quality and monetization. ONE doesn't draw the kind of fighters that the UFC does. For every Roberto Soldic, you have 4 to 5 can crushers ending up at ONE Championship, who just get flown in to predictably be beaten up by their Asian fighters in order to raise the profile of them.

I am not really mad about that. It is fight(er) promoting 101. But by the same token, I will not sit here and pretend that it doesn't happen, when it is bloody obvious to anybody, who can navigate the Tapology site.

EDIT: Also, anybody doing a deep dive into the financial situation of ONE will quickly realize, that their financial situation is looking increasingly dim. They are hovering around 400 Million in the hole .....",2023-06-02T06:24:17Z,0

Also, his favoritism with certain fighters puts certain weight classes on hold forever. Khazmat shouldve fought at least 2 times this year. Shavkat shouldve been fighting guys in the top 5. But no, they dont talk well so we dont get to see the best in the sport perform. And i wont even  go into detail about how horrendously over priced ppv are and how underpaid fighters are .

1642,"As a martial artist, I definitely prefer one championship considerably over the UFC, as I think the whole culture of the organization is more centered around the art and craft of combat sports and the skill and virtuosity of the fighters than it is about the money, flash, and image like in the UFC... to sum up how I feel, the biggest stars in the UFC are mcgregor and Jon jones, who though I'm fans of both, are both known almost as well for their out of ring hijinks as they are their actual martial prowess, whereas ONE'S biggest stars are Rodtang and Mighty Mouse, who are both famous almost exclusively because of how exceptional their respective skills are. Jon is still probably the world's most dangerous hand to hand combatant, but due to the reality TV show esc vibe surrounding the UFC and the majority of their fan base, the conversation is far less on his insane talent and more on his personal troubles, and as a true martial arts organization, that shouldn't be. I know it sells, I know it's just business, but to my tastes, ONE seems to have alot less of that crap and it's refreshing.",2023-06-01T05:20:49Z,0

I'm sure fighting sports have been staple in thailand, Cambodia, Burma, etc, for centuries?? I'm I wrong.? Well before One Championship.

1768,"idk, maybe I'm missing the point here, but when he suggests that creating yet another MMA league is somehow ""helping humanity"", I'm taken aback a bit.. I mean sure, some fighters who come from humble beginnings might rise, but lets face it, it's not exactly ""easy"", nor is it particularly ""helpful"" when you have to smash someone and get smashed yourself to rise out of poverty.. yeah, I don't see the correlation between  One Championship and ""helping humanity"".. if anything, it's just another ""entertainment"" product that suppose to give the masses some gratification via ""circus"", something akin to Roman Coliseum Games, which included gladiator fights, deadly chariot races, etc.. these things are distractions, in my opinion.. Now if he would've started a large desalination plant or a massive automated farming project in Afrika, or build a factory that would produce very cheap modular homes, or create a medical R&D facility that would work on finding cancer treatments and making vaccines inexpensive & readily available for less-developed countries, or even get into sustainable energy field, then I could understand his claim of ""trying to help humanity"".. Martial arts, however, apart from encouraging ""spiritual strength"" and discipline, doesn't bring to mind a picture of common good.. if anything, when I think about martial arts, especially competitive part of it, I envision trauma, underpayment for athletes, lack of health insurance, and most importantly, consequences at the later stages in life, which, with the lack of achievements in the ring and eventually ""pensions"", regular fighters who haven't achieved stardom unfortunately move to obscurity, where they have to suffer alone.. And to be honest this guy is not the first ""hedge-fund CEO/bro"" who all of a sudden experience ""spiritual awakening"" and decide that their next venture will ""help humanity"".. some do invest into projects that could have potentially positive results down the line, but more often then not it ends up just another cash-grab venture.. and in this case if the guy cared ""only"" about martial arts and its positive influences, he could've started a chain of dojos which could preach ""spirituality and strength through martial arts"".. instead he chose to create what's essentially a copy of UFC with some nuances..
Anyways, perhaps I'm wrong and don't see the whole picture.. maybe covertly One Championship is training ninjas who then perform missions to save women and kids from human traffickers.. or maybe during One fights a subliminal message is being transmitted that is making people nicer to each other..
In any case, it's a nice ""rags-to-riches"" story.. you can almost create a Disney animated film about this.. or better yet, an Anime ;-)",2023-05-30T09:28:18Z,0

He was the NO. 1 fighter in the UFC, never lost to anyone, but since UFC couldn't find a better opponent for him, they decided to ban the whole division he was fighting in. 
And things like that gets emotionally attached to general public and viewers, because they can see that UFC was being unfair to DJ. And as soon as they let DJ go, The ONE championship got hold of DJ, giving him all the praise, respect and payments that he deserved as the fighter. We, as the general public, can see and rationalise what's going on. The sympathetic side of our heart has some respect for The One now.

2037,What an inspiring story. I started watching ONE when Mighty Mouse got traded from the UFC and I have been very impressed with their promotion. One thing I've never liked about the UFC is how Dana and the organization treats their fighters. It's all about generating pay-per-views by promoting toxic personalities and then throwing away fighters when they don't get with the program. It's refreshing to see the direction that ONE Championship is taking the fight game.,2023-05-28T18:09:56Z,222

For such a 'respectful guy' chatri lied about Francis when he wasn't able to sign him.

Furthermore, the divisions of one don't even come close to how deep the UFC are and although it is popular to say one is now the second best organisation I would still argue that Bellator has the second deepest organisation when it comes to MMA.

So his family from a third world country went from doing well to abject poverty.
He was able to attend Harvard without a full ride!!!
An MBA for two years would have cost 200K+. He said family couldn‚Äôt help him. 
He made 200K + teaching Muay Thai and delivering Chinese food and put him through business school.
His mom slept on the floor with him in Harvard. With a budget of 4$ a day, he was able to fly out his mom from Thailand to live with him in his dorm.

I love beyond anything his true care and compassion for his fighters and his unstoppable fire to do great in the world through his work and knowledge. I'm so happy to see this man succeed and wish nothing but the best for him, his IG posts and descriptions have inspired me to be greater for a long as I can remember and if we were 1% of what Chatri is I genuinely think the world would be a better place. 

ONE, and Chatri, for its philosophy, conection to the fighters and promoting good in the world through promoting the good deeds and sportsmanship that happen inside and outside the octagon is beyond a breath of fresh air after seeing so much disgusting hatred, smacktalk and negativity promoted with money and greed being the only motivator beyond anything else. I'm of course speaking of UFC's 4-5 previous years and it's only gettting worse.

Almost like the fights are occurring at 2.5x speed of what the fights in the UFC are. The fighters themselves are mysterious men of violence since we don't get long expository episodes on their lives before a fight. But you find yourself becoming a fan of the fighter and not the personality or character. No drama, no Shakespeare... just violence.

We planned on doing so much, going so many places together as father and son, and more.  I was 22 and pop ended having a stroke three days after we drove in from outta town where we lived and we kicked it with him & him with us. My sons were already hooked on grandpop and then 3 days later [snap]...my sons, myself, even my wife were utterly destroyed. I come from a musical family, my father was the greatest singer everyone he ever met and all of his friends and our family ever heard. And although i was honored to have that gift as well, when he died a big piece of me did too. And that big piece apparently housed in the part of me that died with Pop. I'm about to be 29 and haven't sang so much as a note since I sung at his funeral. But hearing this great man's story and with him going through a similar situation, it is beyond encouraging to hear of what he did and said.

Timme will tell....hopefully they push each other to be better.
I have to say I really like the guy here running the organization....he seems like a good all around person who isnt simply after greed....too many like past presidents from Bellator etc seemed to just be bad people....same with pride being run by terrible human beings....in the end though its about the end result and entertainment.....

I don't know if ONE can overcome UFC in terms of popularity, fame, and moolah
What I know is that ONE can, and will deliver you those solid fights, if you think two top lvl should fight, they will
ONE in my eyes is more like a fighting game tournament, while the west MMA org is more akin to Boxing in format


What do I mean by fighting game tournament ?
It means that there's (almost) no beef, no arficial buildup (the hype man kind), it's just two fighter in a cage (in a sense)
If you haven't seen it go search for some, Tekken7, DBZ, or Street Fighter finals, it's hype yo but it's because of the clash of the skills

They come there to reach that goal, to be the best
And we come to watch it, to see if these lads are the real article

Western MMA and boxing from what I see focused on the fighters as characters in a story
ONE focused on their fighters as warriors, fighting in ""the pit""

Is this why Dagestani are hated ? Because they don't have enough ""personality"" to be a character

Sick of Dana. Not that he isn't sharp in many ways but he cares only about the money for himself. He is not an honest man and doesn't care who he hurts.

They can't sell tickets and can't get ppv buys and this is a fact, I live in Singapore, the country that ONE is operating out of. They are constantly giving out free tickets because they can't sell fights. Not only that, look at their financial statements, they make millions of dollars in losses every year. Charti is still burning money. Their social media data and stats are all inflated numbers from the company. Their real social media numbers are actually really bad. Slap FC social media numbers are better than ONE. ONE is meant to be the Eastern powerhouse yet they can't even attract the best Eastern fighters to fight for them. The best Chinese fighters are in the UFC, not ONE. In mma, UFC is far superior, in bjj, IBJJF is more legitimate, Glory is the best kickboxing brand. The only thing ONE is the best at is for Muay Thai, but that's because no big company is even going for the muay thai market, hence they are not competing with anyone big. ONE is a failure, westerners love to paint a narrative that the big giant will eventually fall because everyone likes an underdog story. But if you really look into the numbers and actually come down to the East side, you'll see how poorly run ONE is.",2023-05-27T12:48:57Z,0

In ONE they all look like they escaped a mad surgeon. They are ugly and fake it's cringe. But it's OK because the female fighters looks better than the ring girls in Asia. (my guess is the ring girls over there are ladyboys)
