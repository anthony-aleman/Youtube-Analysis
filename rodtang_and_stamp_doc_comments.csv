With that said, as a father, seeing small children doing full-contact fighting on a professional level is really frightening. It is the national sport of Thailand, and is absolutely ingrained in their culture, but it's really hard to watch kids as young as 8 taking that kind of damage before their brains have even come close to being fully developed. Great topic, Academic! Admittedly, it's a hard watch, but you'll always get my like and comment.
